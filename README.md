`release-please` generates GitHub PRs for library releases based on the
[conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) commit
specification and [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

_Release Please_ can be configured (using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions),
a cron, or a step during CI/CD) to maintain a PR that represents the next release
or your libary.

When the candidate PR is merged, _Release Please_ can be configured to create
a [GitHub Release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases).

Here's an [example of Release Please in action](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-logging/pull/487).

## Maintaining a Release PR

To configure _Release Please_ to maintain an up-to-date release
pull-request on your repository, setup the following command to execute
when changes are pushed to `master`:

```bash

  --repo-url=googleapis/nodejs-firestore \
  --token=$GITHUB_TOKEN
```

* `--package-name`: is the name of the package to publish to publish to
  an upstream registry such as npm.
* `--repo-url`: is the URL of the repository on GitHub.
* `--token`: a token with write access to `--repo-url`.

### Creating GitHub Releases

To configure _Release Please_ to generate GitHub Releases when release
pull-requests are merged to `master`, setup the following command to
execute when changes are pushed to `master`:

```bash
release-please github-release --repo-url=googleapis/nodejs-firestore \
  --token=$GITHUB_TOKEN
```

* `--repo-url`: is the URL of the repository on GitHub.
* `--token`: a token with write access to `--repo-url`.

### GitHub Actions

An elegant way to configure `Release Please` is through 
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). To generate a

```

* `--package-name`: is the name of the package to publish to publish to
  an upstream registry such as npm.



## Versioning

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).



This library is considered to be in **beta**. This means it is expected to be
mostly stable while we work toward a general availability release; however,
complete stability is not guaranteed. We will address issues and requests
against beta libraries with a high priority.
