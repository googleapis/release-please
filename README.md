`release-please` generates GitHub PRs for library releases based on the
[conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) commit
specification and [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

_Release Please_ can be configured (using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions),
a cron, or a step during CI/CD) to maintain a PR that represents the next release
of your library.

When the candidate PR is merged, _Release Please_ can be configured to create
a [GitHub Release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases).

Here's an [example of Release Please in action](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-logging/pull/487).

### The _Release Please_ Repository:

## Quickstart

### Installing the client library

```bash
npm install release-please
```

## Maintaining a Release PR

To configure _Release Please_ to maintain an up-to-date release
pull-request on your repository, setup the following command to execute
when changes are pushed to `master`:

```bash
release-please release-pr --package-name=@google-cloud/firestore" \
  --repo-url=googleapis/nodejs-firestore \
  --token=$GITHUB_TOKEN
```

* `--package-name`: is the name of the package to publish to publish to
  an upstream registry such as npm.
* `--repo-url`: is the URL of the repository on GitHub.
* `--token`: a token with write access to `--repo-url`.

### Creating GitHub Releases

To configure _Release Please_ to generate GitHub Releases when release
pull-requests are merged to `master`, setup the following command to
execute when changes are pushed to `master`:

```bash
release-please github-release --repo-url=googleapis/nodejs-firestore \
  --token=$GITHUB_TOKEN
```

* `--repo-url`: is the URL of the repository on GitHub.
* `--token`: a token with write access to `--repo-url`.

### GitHub Actions

An elegant way to configure `Release Please` is through
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). To generate a
`main.workflow` for `Release Please`, simply run:

```bash
release-please generate-action --package-name=@google-cloud/firestore"
```

* `--package-name`: is the name of the package to publish to publish to
  an upstream registry such as npm.



## Supported Node.js Versions

Our client libraries follow the [Node.js release schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).
Libraries are compatible with all current _active_ and _maintenance_ versions of
Node.js.

Client libraries targetting some end-of-life versions of Node.js are available, and
can be installed via npm [dist-tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag).
The dist-tags follow the naming convention `legacy-(version)`.

_Legacy Node.js versions are supported as a best effort:_

* Legacy versions will not be tested in continuous integration.
* Some security patches may not be able to be backported.
* Dependencies will not be kept up-to-date, and features will not be backported.

#### Legacy tags available

* `legacy-8`: install client libraries from this dist-tag for versions
  compatible with Node.js 8.

## Versioning

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).



This library is considered to be in **beta**. This means it is expected to be
mostly stable while we work toward a general availability release; however,
complete stability is not guaranteed. We will address issues and requests
against beta libraries with a high priority.
