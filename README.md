# [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/release-please.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/release-please)
[![codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/googleapis/release-please/main.svg?style=flat)](https://codecov.io/gh/googleapis/release-please)

Release Please automates CHANGELOG generation, the creation of GitHub releases,
and version bumps for your projects.

It does so by parsing your
git history, looking for [Conventional Commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/),
and creating release PRs.

It does not handle publication to package managers or handle complex branch
management.

## What's a Release PR?

Rather than continuously releasing what's landed to your default branch,
release-please maintains Release PRs:

<img width="400" src="/screen.png">

These Release PRs are kept up-to-date as additional work is merged. When you're
ready to tag a release, simply merge the release PR. Both squash-merge and
merge commits work with Release PRs.

When the Release PR is merged, release-please takes the following steps:

1. Updates your changelog file (for example `CHANGELOG.md`), along with other language specific files (for example `package.json`).
2. Tags the commit with the version number
3. Creates a GitHub Release based on the tag

You can tell where the Release PR is in its lifecycle by the status label on the
PR itself:

- `autorelease: pending` is the initial state of the Release PR before it is merged
- `autorelease: tagged` means that the Release PR has been merged and the release has been tagged in GitHub
- `autorelease: snapshot` is a special state for snapshot version bumps
- `autorelease: published` means that a GitHub release has been published based on the Release PR (_release-please does not automatically add this tag, but we recommend it as a convention for publication tooling_).

## How should I write my commits?

Release Please assumes you are using [Conventional Commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

The most important prefixes you should have in mind are:

* `fix:` which represents bug fixes, and correlates to a [SemVer](https://semver.org/)
  patch.
* `feat:` which represents a new feature, and correlates to a SemVer minor.
* `feat!:`,  or `fix!:`, `refactor!:`, etc., which represent a breaking change
  (indicated by the `!`) and will result in a SemVer major.

### Linear git commit history (use squash-merge)

We **highly** recommend that you use squash-merges when merging pull requests.
A linear git history makes it much easier to:

* Follow history - commits are sorted by merge date and are not mixed between
  pull requests
* Find and revert bugs - `git bisect` is helpful for tracking down which
  change introduced a bug
* Control the release-please changelog - when you merge a PR, you may have
  commit messages that make sense within the scope of the PR, but don't
  make sense when merged in the main branch. For example, you make have
  `feat: introduce feature A` and then `fix: some bugfix introduced in
  the first commit`. The `fix` commit is actually irrelevant to the release
  notes as there was never a bug experienced in the main branch.
* Keep a clean main branch - if you use something like red/green development
  (create a failing test in commit A, then fix in commit B) and merge (or
  rebase-merge), then there will be points in time in your main branch where
  tests do not pass.

### What if my PR contains multiple fixes or features?

Release Please allows you to represent multiple changes in a single commit,
using footers:

```txt
feat: adds v4 UUID to crypto

This adds support for v4 UUIDs to the library.

fix(utils): unicode no longer throws exception
  PiperOrigin-RevId: 345559154
  BREAKING-CHANGE: encode method no longer throws.
  Source-Link: googleapis/googleapis@5e0dcb2

feat(utils): update encode to support unicode
  PiperOrigin-RevId: 345559182
  Source-Link: googleapis/googleapis@e5eef86
```

The above commit message will contain:

1. an entry for the **"adds v4 UUID to crypto"** feature.
2. an entry for the fix **"unicode no longer throws exception"**, along with a note
  that it's a breaking change.
3. an entry for the feature **"update encode to support unicode"**.

:warning: **Important:** The additional messages must be added to the bottom of the commit.

## How do I change the version number?

When a commit to the main branch has `Release-As: x.x.x` (case insensitive) in the **commit body**, Release Please will open a new pull request for the specified version.

**Empty commit example:**

`git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: release 2.0.0" -m "Release-As: 2.0.0"` results in the following commit message:

```txt
chore: release 2.0.0

Release-As: 2.0.0
```

## How can I fix release notes?

If you have merged a pull request and would like to amend the commit message
used to generate the release notes for that commit, you can edit the body of
the merged pull requests and add a section like:

```
BEGIN_COMMIT_OVERRIDE
feat: add ability to override merged commit message

fix: another message
chore: a third message
END_COMMIT_OVERRIDE
```

The next time Release Please runs, it will use that override section as the
commit message instead of the merged commit message.

:warning: **Important:** This feature will not work with plain merges because
release-please does not know which commit(s) to apply the override to. [We
recommend using squash-merge instead](#linear-git-commit-history-use-squash-merge).

## Release Please bot does not create a release PR. Why?

### Step 1: Ensure releasable units are merged

Release Please creates a release pull request after it notices the default branch
contains "releasable units" since the last release.
A releasable unit is a commit to the branch with one of the following
prefixes: "feat", "fix", and "deps".
(A "chore" or "build" commit is not a releasable unit.)

Some languages have their specific releasable unit configuration. For example,
"docs" is a prefix for releasable units in Java and Python.

### Step 2: Ensure no `autorelease: pending` or `autorelease: triggered` label in an old PR

Check existing pull requests labelled with `autorelease: pending` or
`autorelease: triggered` label.
Due to GitHub API failures, it's possible that the tag was not removed
correctly upon a previous release and Release Please thinks that the previous release is
still pending.
If you're certain that there's no pending release, remove the
`autorelease: pending` or `autorelease: triggered` label.

For the GitHub application users, Release Please will not create a new pull request
if there's an existing pull request labeled as `autorelease: pending`.
To confirm this case, search for a pull request with the label.
(It's very likely it's the latest release pull request.)
If you find a release pull request with the label and it is not going to be released
(or already released), then remove the `autorelease: pending` label and re-run Release
Please.

### Step 3: Rerun Release Please

If you think Release Please missed creating a release PR after a pull request
with a releasable unit has been merged, please re-run `release-please`. If you are using
the GitHub application, add `release-please:force-run` label to the merged pull request. If
you are using the action, look for the failed invocation and retry the workflow run.
Release Please will process the pull request immediately to find releasable units.

Release Please also supports releasing multiple artifacts from the same repository.
See more at [manifest-releaser.md](docs/manifest-releaser.md).

## Supported Node.js Versions

Our client libraries follow the [Node.js release schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).
Libraries are compatible with all current _active_ and _maintenance_ versions of
Node.js.

Client libraries targeting some end-of-life versions of Node.js are available, and
can be installed via npm [dist-tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag).
The dist-tags follow the naming convention `legacy-(version)`.

_Legacy Node.js versions are supported as a best effort:_

* Legacy versions will not be tested in continuous integration.
* Some security patches may not be able to be backported.
* Dependencies will not be kept up-to-date, and features will not be backported.

#### Legacy tags available

* `legacy-8`: install client libraries from this dist-tag for versions
  compatible with Node.js 8.
