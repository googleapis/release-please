# Customizing Releases

release-please provides several configuration options to allow customizing
your release process.

### Adding additional strategy types

To add a new release type, simply use the existing [strategies](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please/tree/main/src/strategies) and [updaters](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please/tree/main/src/updaters)
as a starting point.

## Versioning Strategies

A versioning strategy's job is to determine how to increment a SemVer
version given a list of parsed commits.

| Versioning Strategy | Description                                                                                                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `default`           | Breaking changes bump the major version, features bump the minor version, bugfixes bump the patch version   |
| `always-bump-patch` | Always bump patch version. This is useful for backporting bugfixes to previous major/minor release branches |
| `always-bump-minor` | Always bump minor version |                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `always-bump-major` | Always bump major version |                                                                                  
| `service-pack`      | Designed for Java backport fixes. Uses Maven's specification for service pack versions (e.g. 1.2.3-sp.1)    |

### Adding additional versioning strategy types

To add a new versioning strategy, create a new class that implements the
[`VersioningStrategy` interface](/src/versioning-strategy.ts).

## Subdirectories (paths) in a repository

Release Please can operate on a subdirectory of a repository. If you configure a `path`,
Release Please will only consider commits that touch files on that path. The format of the
`path` configuration option should be a simple path segment (`.`, `..`, etc are not allowed)
relative to the repository root.

To configure multiple components on different paths, configure a
[manifest release](/docs/manifest-releaser.md).

## Changelog Types

A changelog type's job is to build the CHANGELOG notes given a list
of parsed commits. This generated content is used in the release pull request body
and in release notes. By replacing the implementation, you can control how your
release notes appear.

| Changelog Type | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| `default` | Default CHANGELOG notes builder. Groups by commit type and links to pull requests and commits |
| `github` | Uses the [GitHub API][release-notes-api] to generate notes |

[release-notes-api]: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/releases?apiVersion=2022-11-28#generate-release-notes-content-for-a-release

### Adding additional changelog types

To add a new changelog type, create a new class that implements the
[`ChangelogNotes` interface](/src/changelog-notes.ts).

## Pull Requests

### Opening as a draft pull request

If you would like to open the release pull request as a draft, you can
use the `--draft-pull-request` CLI flag or the `draft-pull-request` option
in the manifest configuration.

### Pull Request Title

If you would like to customize the pull request title, you can use the
`--pull-request-title-pattern` CLI option or the `pull-request-title-pattern`
option in the manifest configuration.

The pattern uses string replacement and regular expressions to build and
parse the pull request title. Note that we must be able to parse out the
component and version from the pull request (either via the pull request
title or body format).

The default pull request title uses this pattern:
`chore${scope}: release${component} ${version}` so a common release pull
request title would be `chore(main): release foo-bar v1.2.3`.

| Pattern | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `${scope}` | This pattern is used for specifying the conventional commit scope (e.g. `chore(scope): some message`). We expect that the target branch name is used for the scope value |
| `${component}` | The name of the component being released |
| `${version}` | The version of the component being released |
| `${branch?}` | The target branch of the pull request. If you have multiple release branches, this helps identify which release branch we are working on |

### Pull Request Header

If you would like to customize the pull request header, you can use the
`--pull-request-header` CLI option or the `pull-request-header`
option in the manifest configuration.

By default, the pull request header is:
`:robot: I have created a release *beep* *boop*`.

## Release Lifecycle Labels

By default, we open release pull requests with the `autorelease: pending`
label. This label along with the branch name of the release pull request
helps us identify merged release pull requests that need to be tagged with a
release.

After we have tagged the release, we remove the `autorelease: pending` label
and add the `autorelease: tagged` label.

You can customize the "pending" pull request label(s) via the `--label` CLI
option or the `label` option in the manifest configuration.

You can customize the "tagged" pull request label(s) via the
`--release-label` CLI option or the `release-label` option in the manifest
configuration.

## Updating arbitrary files

For most release strategies, you can provide additional files to update
using the [Generic](/src/updaters/generic.ts) updater. You can specify
a comma separated list of file paths with the `--extra-files` CLI option
or the `extra-files` option in the manifest configuration.

```json
{
  "extra-files": [
    "path/to/file.md"
  ]
}
```

To mark versions needing an update in those files, you will add annotations
(usually in comments).

You can annotate a line (inline) via:

* `x-release-please-version`
* `x-release-please-major`
* `x-release-please-minor`
* `x-release-please-patch`

For these annotations, we will try to replace the value on that line only.

You can annotate a block by starting with a line containing:

* `x-release-please-start-version`
* `x-release-please-start-major`
* `x-release-please-start-minor`
* `x-release-please-start-patch`

and close the block with a line containing `x-release-please-end`. Within
the block, we will attempt to replace version values.

## Updating arbitrary JSON files

For most release strategies, you can provide additional files to update
using the [GenericJson](/src/updaters/generic-json.ts) updater. You can
specify a configuration object in the `extra-files` option in the manifest
configuration.

```json
{
  "extra-files": [
    {
      "type": "json",
      "path": "path/to/file.json",
      "jsonpath": "$.json.path.to.field"
    }
  ]
}
```

[JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) is a simple query syntax
for JSON that is similar to XPath for XML. The `jsonpath` configuration
informs release-please on which JSON field to update with the new version.

## Updating arbitrary XML files

For most release strategies, you can provide additional files to update
using the [GenericXml](/src/updaters/generic-xml.ts) updater. You can
specify a configuration object in the `extra-files` option in the manifest
configuration.

```json
{
  "extra-files": [
    {
      "type": "xml",
      "path": "path/to/file.xml",
      "xpath": "//xpath/to/field"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Updating arbitrary YAML files

For most release strategies, you can provide additional files to update
using the [GenericYaml](/src/updaters/generic-yaml.ts) updater. You can
specify a configuration object in the `extra-files` option in the manifest
configuration.

```json
{
  "extra-files": [
    {
      "type": "yaml",
      "path": "path/to/file.yaml",
      "jsonpath": "$.json.path.to.field"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Updating arbitrary TOML files

For most release strategies, you can provide additional files to update
using the [GenericToml](/src/updaters/generic-toml.ts) updater. You can
specify a configuration object in the `extra-files` option in the manifest
configuration.

```json
{
  "extra-files": [
    {
      "type": "toml",
      "path": "path/to/file.toml",
      "jsonpath": "$.json.path.to.field"
    }
  ]
}
```
