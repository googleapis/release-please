## Create a manifest pull request [deprecated]

This CLI command is deprecated in favor of `release-pr` which handles this path with the
same options. This command is preserved for backward compatibility and will be removed in the
next major version.

This command can be run anytime and it will create or update a release PR. It
labels the PR as `"autorelease: pending"` (used by `manifest-release`).

### Create a manifest release [deprecated]

This CLI command is deprecated in favor of `github-release` which handles this path with the
same options. This command is preserved for backward compatibility and will be removed in the
next major version.

This command should run sometime after a release PR has been merged and before
the next release PR is merged. It will create GitHub Releases based on the
last merged release PR it finds (which is why you don't want to let two release
PRs merge without running it). If successful it will remove the
`"autorelease: pending"` label and adds the `"autorelease: tagged"` label.
Creating all the releases is not transactional. If any fail to create the
command can be re-run safely to finish creating releases.

```bash
❯ release-please manifest-release --help
release-please manifest-release

create releases/tags from last release-PR using a manifest file

Options:
  --help            Show help                                          [boolean]
  --version         Show version number                                [boolean]
  --debug           print verbose errors (use only for local debugging).
                                                      [boolean] [default: false]
  --trace           print extra verbose errors (use only for local debugging).
                                                      [boolean] [default: false]

  --api-url         URL to use when making API requests

  --graphql-url     URL to use when making GraphQL requests
                                    [string] [default: "https://api.github.com"]

  --repo-url        GitHub URL to generate release for                [required]
  --dry-run         Prepare but do not take action    [boolean] [default: false]
  --draft           mark release as a draft. no tag is created but tag_name and
                    target_commitish are associated with the release for future
                    tag creation upon "un-drafting" the release.
                                                      [boolean] [default: false]
  --label           comma-separated list of labels to remove to from release PR

  --config-file     where can the config file be found in the project?
